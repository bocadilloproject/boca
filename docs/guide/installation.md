# Installation

::: warning REQUIREMENTS
Queso is compatible with **Python 3.6+**.
:::

1. Install Queso using `pip`:

```bash
pip install queso
```

2. Try it out:

```bash
$ queso -V
Queso: 0.2.0
Bocadillo: 0.13.1
Python: 3.7.2
OS: Darwin-18.2.0-x86_64-i386-64bit
```

Note: you may have another OS or a different version of Queso, Bocadillo, or Python installed.

Although Queso was made to work hand in hand with [Bocadillo](https://bocadilloproject.github.io), you'll need to install Bocadillo separately. Some commands will not work if you don't have Bocadillo installed.
