# Introduction

Queso is the official development toolkit for building applications with [Bocadillo][bocadillo].

Features include:

- Zero-configuration: Once installed, you can run and extend Queso out of the box.
- Extensibility: automate common tasks with custom commands.
- Familiarity: Queso is built on top of [Click][click] and doesn't hide it from you. Anything you can do with Click, you can do with Queso.

::: tip NOTE
While Queso does not have many commands built-in yet, we are working towards
bringing in more.

Thought about a super-useful command you'd like to see added?
Go ahead and [open a feature request on GitHub][feature-requests]!
