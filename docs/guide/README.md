# Introduction

Queso is the official development toolkit for building applications with [Bocadillo](https://bocadilloproject.github.io).

Features include:

- Zero-configuration: Once installed, you can run and extend Queso out of the box.
- Extensibility: automate common tasks with custom commands.
- Familiarity: Queso is built on top of [Click](http://click.palletsprojects.com). Anything you can do with Click, you can do with Queso.

::: tip CONTRIBUTING
