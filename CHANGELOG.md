## [v0.1.0] - 2019-01-25

This release focuses on reimplementing the behavior of the CLI built into the `bocadillo` package as of v0.10.1, with some additions and slight changes.

### Added

- `version` command, also accessible using `-v`, `-V` and `--version` flags.
- `init:custom` command.
- Programmatic usage using the `call_command()` helper.
- Documentation site.

### Changed

Relative to Bocadillo v0.10.1:

- Custom commands:
  - It is not mendatory anymore to declare a `click.Group` in the custom commands file. All `click.Command` objects declared in the file are mounted onto `queso`. This includes commands declared with `@click.command()`, groups declared with `@click.group()` and any other instance of a subclass of `click.Command`.
  - **BREAKING**: The environment variable changed from `BOCA_CUSTOM_COMMANDS_FILE` to `BOCA_CUSTOM_COMMANDS`.
